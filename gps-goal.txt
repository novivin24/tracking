Goals for the GPS development
- change the prototype physical configuration from using ArduPilot Pixhawk to Arduino Mega with ESP8266
- migrate the system from plug and play to configure each components manually
- increase the accuracy by implementing x-Kalman Filter and encoder then add the IMU sensor if needed
- test run
